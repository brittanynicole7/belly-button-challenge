# Belly Button Challenge

# Project Description 

## Create a Dashboard with 3 Visualizations and a Table to Display Sample Metadata.
- Use D3 to read in the samples.json file from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json
- Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs for each person in the dataset.
- Create a bubble chart that displays different OTUs per each individual by different colors and the OTU sample values for the marker size.
- Display the sample metadata for each individual in a table. 
- Create a gauge chart to display belly button washing frequency as the amount of scrubs per week. 
- Develop code so that the metadata and charts change as a new person is selected. 
- Display the tables as a dashboard. 
- Deploy the app to GitHub Pages.
